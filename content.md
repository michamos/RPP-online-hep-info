# Particle Data Group (PDG) resources

* **Review of Particle Physics (RPP):**
    A comprehensive report on the fields of particle physics and related areas of cosmology and astrophysics, including both review articles and a compilation/evaluation of data on particle properties. The review section includes articles, tables and plots on a wide variety of theoretical and experimental topics of interest to particle physicists and astrophysicists. The particle properties section provides tables of published measurements as well as the Particle Data Group's best values and limits for particle properties such as masses, widths, lifetimes, and branching fractions, as well as an extensive summary of searches for hypothetical particles. RPP is published as a large book every two years, with partial updates made available once each year on the web.

    All the contents of the book version of RPP are available online: <http://pdg.lbl.gov>

    The printed book can be ordered: <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/html/receive_our_products.html>

    Of historical interest is the complete RPP collection which can be found online: <http://pdg.lbl.gov/rpp-archive/> <http://library.cern/PDG_publications/review_particle_physics>

* **Particle Physics booklet:**
    An abridged version of the Review of Particle Physics, available as a pocket-sized 250-page booklet. It is one of the most useful summaries of physics data. The booklet contains an abbreviated set of reviews and the summary tables from the most recent edition of the Review of Particle Physics.

# Particle Physics Information Platforms

* **INSPIRE:**
    INSPIRE serves as a one-stop information platform for the particle physics community, comprising 8 interlinked databases on literature, conferences, institutions, journals, researchers, experiments, jobs and data. Run in collaboration by CERN, DESY, Fermilab, IHEP, IN2P3, and SLAC, it has been serving the scientific community for almost 50 years. Previously known as SPIRES, it was the first website outside Europe and the first database on the web. Close interaction with the user community and with arXiv, ADS, HEPData, ORCID, PDG and publishers is the backbone of INSPIRE's evolution. <http://inspirehep.net/>

    In 2019, INSPIRE launched INSPIRE beta, featuring all-new literature search, author profiles and job postings. INSPIRE beta is running in parallel with the current platform and it will fully replace it in the future. The INSPIRE beta site is available at: <http://beta.inspirehep.net>

This platform is currently in a pilot stage. It is accessible by LHC experimental groups (standard collaboration access restrictions are applied). <https://analysispreservation.cern.ch>

* **DASPOS:**
    A collective effort to explore the realisation of a viable data, software and algorithm preservation architecture in High Energy Physics <https://daspos.crc.nd.edu>

DPHEP, which was initiated as a study group in 2008-2009, includes all major HEP experiments and labs. In 2014, it has become a Collaboration through the signature of a Collaboration Agreement by a number of large funding agencies.
    The group is endorsed by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).

    DPHEP regularly organizes workshops, creates status reports, and maintains links with similar activities in other disciplines. Details of the organizational structure, the objectives, workshops and publications can be found on the website. <http://dphep.org>

* **REANA:**
    REANA (REusable ANAlyses) is a system for instantiating research data analyses on the cloud using container-based solutions.

* **RECAST:**
    Building on analysis preservation and re-use infrastructure of the LHC experiments, RECAST acts as a science gateway allowing theorists to suggest new reinterpretations of archived analyses of the LHC dataset. Experiments review suggestions and, if approved, simulate the proposed models and re-run the archived analysis to determine their viability. Such reinterpretation results are then appended to the records of the original publication in the relevant digital archives.
    Its new website should be available soon at: <http://recast.cern.ch>

* **International Masterclasses:**
    Each year about 13,000 high school students in 55 countries come to one of about 225 nearby universities or research centres for a day to unravel the mysteries of particle physics. Lectures from active scientists give insight in topics and methods of basic research enabling the students to perform measurements on real data from one of seven experiments. At the end of the day, like an international research collaboration, participants join a video conference for discussion and combination of results. The program is coordinated from Institut fur Kern- und Teilchenphysik at TU Dresden and the Notre Dame University QuarkNet Center within the framework of the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG). CERN, Fermilab and TRIUMF support videoconferences. World Wide Data Day - https://quarknet.org/content/world-wide-data-day is an annual event.
