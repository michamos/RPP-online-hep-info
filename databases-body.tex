\section{Introduction}\IndexEntry{dbppd}%

The collection of online information resources in particle physics and related areas presented in this chapter is of necessity incomplete. An expanded and regularly updated online version can be found at 
	\item{}\qquad{{\tt http://library.web.cern.ch/library/rpp}. }\rm

Suggestions for additions and updates are very welcome. 


\section{Particle Data Group (PDG) resources}\IndexEntry{dbpart}%

\item{$\bullet$}REVIEW OF PARTICLE PHYSICS (RPP):
A comprehensive report on the fields of particle physics and cosmology, including both review articles and a compilation/evaluation of data on particle properties.ÂThe review section includes articles, tables and plots on a wide variety of theoretical and experimental topics of interest to particle physicists and astrophysicists. The particle properties section provides tables of published measurements as well as the Particle Data Group's best values and limits for particle properties such as masses, widths, lifetimes, and branching fractions, and an extensive summary of searches for hypothetical particles. RPP is published as a 1400-page book every two years, with partial updates made available once each year on the web. All the contents of the 1400-page book version of RPP are available online at:

\item{$\bullet$}
PARTICLE PHYSICS BOOKLET:  
An abridged version of the Review of Particle Physics available as a pocket-sized 300-page booklet. Although produced in print and available online only as a PDF file, the booklet is included in this guide because it is one of the most useful summaries of physics data. The booklet contains an abbreviated set of reviews and the summary tables from the most recent edition of the Review of Particle Physics.

\section{Particle Physics Information Platforms}\IndexEntry{dbdirorg}%

\item{$\bullet$}
SPIRES: This indispensable information tool for high energy physicists worldwide was replaced by INSPIRE in November 2011. SPIRES started as a bibliographic database SPIRES-HEP in 1974 hosted at SLAC in collaboration with DESY and became remotely accessible in the mid 80's. Several databases - CONF, EXP, INST, HEPNames and JOBS - followed and FermiLab joined the team. In December 1991 SPIRES became the first web server outside Europe, from the start closely related to the arXiv repository. For High Energy Physics SPIRES-HEP was the reference for publications, covering not only journal articles and preprints but also conference proceedings, technical reports, theses and other 'gray' literature, the value of the information enhanced by thorough proof-reading, keywords and links to the sister SPIRES databases and other information services. Content and service are now taken over by INSPIRE. 
\medskip


\item{$\bullet$}
INSPIRE: The time-honored SPIRES database suite has now been replaced by INSPIRE which combines the most successful aspects of SPIRES like comprehensive content and high-quality metadata - with the modern technology of Invenio, the CERN open-source digital-library software, offering major improvements like increased speed and Google-like free-text search syntax. INSPIRE serves as one-stop information platform for the particle physics community, comprising 6 interlinked databases on literature, conferences, institutions, researchers, experiments, jobs.
INSPIRE is jointly developed and maintained by the three laboratories that have been running SPIRES (DESY, Fermilab and SLAC) and CERN. Close interaction with the user community and with arXiv, ADS, HepData, PDG and publishers is the backbone of INSPIRE's evolution.

\item{$\bullet$} 
ADS: The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System is a Digital Library portal for 
researchers in Astronomy and Physics, operated by the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under a NASA grant. The ADS maintains 
three bibliographic databases containing more than 9.3 million records: 
Astronomy and Astrophysics, Physics, and arXiv e-prints. 
The main body of data in the ADS consists of bibliographic records, 
which are searchable through highly customizable query forms,
 and full-text scans of much of the astronomical literature 
which can be browsed or searched via a full-text search interface. 
Integrated in its databases, the ADS provides access and pointers 
to a wealth of external resources, including electronic articles, 
data catalogues and archives. In addition, ADS provides the myADS Update Service, a free custom 
%% \vfil\eject

\item{$\bullet$}
INTERNATIONAL MASTERCLASSES: Each year about 6000 high school students in 28 countries come to one of about 130 nearby universities or research centres for one day in order to unravel the mysteries of particle physics. Lectures from active scientists give insight in topics and methods of basic research at the fundaments of matter and forces, enabling the students to perform measurements on real data from particle physics experiments themselves. At the end of each day, like in an international research collaboration, the participants join in a video conference for discussion and combination of their results.
