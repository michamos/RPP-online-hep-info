\section{Introduction}\label{databases:sec:introduction}
\index{Directories, online, people, and organizations}
Online resources are used in a diverse and expanding set of ways in particle physics. 
Many of these resources have become central to our collective work. We provide a brief curated selection of the major resources here. An expanded and regularly
updated online repository is referred to below and can be found at\footnote{Note for reviewers: this will be moved to an official PDG repository soon.} \url{https://github.com/michamos/RPP-online-hep-info} 
By contrast, it is meant to be inclusive and catalog all useful resources related to particle physics. The community is warmly invited to contribute in order to ensure a broad and up to date coverage of relevant resources. Practical details are available online.

\section{Particle physics information
platform}\label{databases:sec:platforms}

\index{Databases!INSPIRE}

  \textbf{INSPIRE:} INSPIRE serves as a one-stop information platform
  for the particle physics community, comprising interlinked databases
  on literature, authors, jobs, seminars, conferences, institutions and
  experiments (each described in more detail below). Run in collaboration by CERN, DESY,
  Fermilab, IHEP, IN2P3, and SLAC, it has been serving the scientific
  community for almost 50 years. Previously known as SPIRES, it was the
  first website outside Europe and the first database on the web. Close
  interaction with the user community and with arXiv, ADS, HEPData,
  ORCID, PDG and publishers is the backbone of INSPIRE's evolution.
  Since 2020, it is running on a modernized platform that is continuously being improved.

\section{Literature databases}\label{databases:sec:literature}

\index{Databases!literature}

Most research articles in the field of high-energy physics are first made
available on the arXiv eprint server, where researchers can learn about the
latest developments by browsing through the new announcements
five days a week. They are indexed, together with all other publications in
high-energy physics and related fields, in the INSPIRE literature collection.
For neighboring fields such as astrophysics or mathematics, other databases are
more exhaustive.

\begin{itemize}
\index{Databases!literature!ADS}
\item
  \textbf{ADS:} The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System is a Digital
  Library portal offering access to 15 million bibliographic records in
  Astronomy and Physics. The ADS search engine also indexes the
  full-text for many publications in this
  collection and tracks citations. The system also provides access and links to a wealth of
  external resources, including electronic articles hosted by publishers
  and arXiv, data catalogs and a variety of data products hosted by the
  astronomy archives worldwide. The ADS can be accessed at:

\index{Data}

Initiatives to preserve and disseminate data produced during different stages
of research, from Monte Carlo events to machine-readable versions of tables in
papers, have grown in recent years.  Unfortunately, there currently exists no
central resource aggregating all these data as is the case for the more
established means of scholarly communication. Instead, there are a number of
repositories targeting different types of data and research subjects. They are
listed in the online version.

\index{Education databases}
\index{Collaboration databases}
\section{Particle Physics Education and Outreach
}\label{databases:sec:edusites}

Particle physics public engagement efforts are widespread, with laboratories, 
experiments, universities and individual researchers engaged in a range
of efforts. The online version of this chapter provides links to resources
for particle physicists wanting to become engaged in public education as 
well as resources that physicists can provide directly to students or lay
people. There are classroom activities, interactive websites, films, and
direct links to education offices at institutions and experiments. Additionally, 
news sites relevant for experts and for the general public are provided.
